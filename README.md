# OCVDAE
An ontology of adverse events associated with cardiovascular disease drugs

OCVDAE is an OAE-extended ontology with a focus on representing the adverse events (AEs) associated with the usage of cardiovascular drugs (CVDs) for treating cardiovascular diseases.

One novel study of the OCVDAE project is the development of the PCR method. Specifically, an AE-specific drug class effect is defined to exist when all the drugs (drug chemical ingredients or drug products) in a drug class are associated with an AE, which is formulated as a proportional class level ratio (“PCR”) = 1.
